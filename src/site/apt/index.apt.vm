Welcome to Rocoto!

  Rocoto is a small collection of reusable Modules for <Google Guice> to make
  easier the task of loading <<<java.util.Properties>>> by reading configuration
  files.

  Rocoto is one of the most spicy pepper in South America, very popular in Peru
  and well known since the age of Incas... it adds some spice to Google Guice
  through configuration files!

Before starting

  Rocoto is available on the Maven Central repo, you just need to add the dependency below in your <<<pom.xml>>> file:

+--------------------------------------+
<dependencies>
  ...
  <dependency>
    <groupId>org.99soft.guice</groupId>

Acknowledgements

  A big <Thank You> goes to: {{{http://devsurf.wordpress.com/}Daniel Manzke}}, thanks to his suggestion under the user
  point of view, helped me making the new Rocoto design much more flexible; Marzia Forli, for testing and bug reporting;
  {{{http://mcculls.blogspot.com/}Stuart McCulloch}} for priceless suggestions for the design;
  Ioannis Canellos for making Rocoto as a valid OSGi bundle.

  This work is dedicated to our city, L'Aquila, destroyed by a terrible
  earthquake the 6th April, 2009... That day more than 300 people were killed
  because buildings collapsed after a magnitudo 6.3 earthquake at 3:32 am.

  We'll never forget that episode.
